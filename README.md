# 🦟 Dengue Case Insights by Demographics and Location Dashboard (Excel)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents an interactive public health analytics dashboard built using Microsoft Excel to analyze dengue case distribution across demographics and geographic locations. The dashboard provides insights into infection rates, affected population groups, and high-risk areas to support data-driven public health planning and disease prevention strategies.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Monitor dengue infection KPIs
- Analyze demographic impact across gender and age groups
- Identify high-risk geographic areas
- Compare infection trends between developed and undeveloped regions
- Support healthcare resource allocation and prevention planning

## 📈 Dashboard Visualizations

### 📊 KPI Metrics
- Total Patients
- Total Affected People
- Average Age of Affected Patients
- Overall Infection Rate
- Infection Rate Comparison (Male vs Female)

### 📉 Analytical Charts

- Dengue Positive Cases by Gender
- Positivity Rate Comparison (Developed vs Undeveloped Areas)
- Top 5 Dengue Impacted Areas
- Dengue Cases Distribution by Age Group (Child, Adult, Senior)
- Interactive Filters by Gender, Age Group, and Area Type

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Adults represent the highest number of dengue cases compared to children and seniors.
- Dengue infection rates remain relatively consistent between males and females.
- Undeveloped areas show slightly higher positivity rates, indicating potential infrastructure and sanitation challenges.
- Jatrabari and Demra are the most dengue-affected areas.
- Seniors have the lowest reported infection cases among all age groups.
- The average affected patient age is approximately 36 years.

## 💡 Public Health Recommendations

- Strengthen mosquito vector control programs in undeveloped and high-risk areas.
- Launch awareness campaigns targeting adult populations who show higher infection rates.
- Prioritize healthcare resource deployment in severely impacted locations such as Jatrabari and Demra.
- Maintain balanced prevention programs across both genders.
- Enhance early detection and screening programs for vulnerable groups such as children and seniors.
